# DBQuery-Mobile-App
This repository contains our work for the final project of CS527 (DB for Data Science). We created an android application that connects to AWS-RDS and AWS-Redshift databases, and displays the results in a tabular format. We used Java(Android Studio) for the front end and a flask backend to connect to AWS. We used the instacart order data to test our application.
